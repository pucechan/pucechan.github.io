As is customary for every new blog, this post hopefully outlines my hopes for the blog and what kind of content you can expect.

<!-- more -->

## So what is this dump?
Basically it's a place for me to write about games, tech and other nerdy subjects in a more casual, informal way. I contribute to gaming website, [GameGrin](http://www.gamegrin.com "Visit GameGrin"), in a more formal manner *(at least in theory)* and regularly appear on their gaming podcast; the imaginatively titled ***GrinCast***.

Having somewhere to talk about things in a more immediate, quicker format should be fun. Especially when it comes to weird esoteric things that interest me!

## So what stuff can I expect?
When it comes to gaming I enjoy a huge spectrum. From 80s microcomputers to the current generation, most things should be covered. Expect the unexpected!

Outside of gaming I have an interest in various programming languages and learning new things. This blog itself is a manifestation of that as I used it as an excuse to learn about static site generation, [Hexo](http://hexo.io), *JavaScript* and [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) as I created the site from scratch.

Whilst I imagine the bulk of the content here will be gaming related there is a good chance other nerdy stuff will pop up from time to time.

Feel free to comment on anything and everything!
