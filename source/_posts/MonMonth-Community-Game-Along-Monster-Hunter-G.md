Anne over at [Chic-Pixel](http://chic-pixel.com/) organises a whole slew of monthly game alongs (as well as a ton of other awesome nerdy content) and this month is #MonMonth, featuring _Monster Hunter_(-like) games.

<!-- more -->

I decided to actually participate this month so I broke out the Wii Classic Controller (Thanks [@Acelister](https://twitter.com/Acelister)!!!) and decided to attempt to play through the Japanese only Wii port of _Monster Hunter G_. This port of the expanded game has a few changes to the PS2 original, changing the control scheme and adding new monsters amongst other things.

I streamed the first 8 or so quests on my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/236175330)/[Mixer](https://mixer.com/pucechan?vod=22772708) channels a couple of days ago and hope to do my next stream this weekend. I don't actually know Japanese at all (outside of recognising some Kana) so me figuring stuff out should be quite amusing and I try and involve the chat as I attempt to make progress.

I highly recommend getting involved, check out [Anne's post](http://chic-pixel.com/2018/03/march-2018-community-game-along-monster-hunter-likes/), and tweet your videos/screenshots and comments with the #MonMonth hashtag!
