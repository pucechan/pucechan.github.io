So it's been a few weeks since my last post, I've had some drama with my domain name being hijacked and all sorts of other shenanigans but it's settling down again so it's about time I ramble!

<!-- more -->

Since my last post the **SNES Classic Mini** has launched and is a fun little thing. It was also broken open within a matter of days as it shares the same hardware as the **NES Classic Mini**. I've been playing mine daily since I bought it and I love the cute little thing to death.

I'll post more about the Mini and link to the review I did for [GameGrin](http://www.gamegrin.com) when it goes live over there (It was finished shortly after it launched, it's just not scheduled to go live yet).

It's safe to say my mission of playing all 21 of the included games prior to launch didn't succeed but I do plan on streaming myself playing through each of the RPGs on the thing at some point.

I'm going to make a concerted effort to stream more frequently as I do enjoy it. I'm finding time management to be a major hurdle at the moment but I need to figure it out!

I need to at least finish helping Mario out on his papercraft adventure on the N64 before the year is up!

Also on the "need to stop procrastinating" list is video content and pod/vodcasts. Due to no good reasons, I still haven't got any video stuff done, I do however regularly participate in the GrinCast for [GameGrin](http://www.gamegrin.com) which is a weekly podcast about gaming and the TransformCast with my friend and Transformers encyclopedia, Acelister, where we talk about each issue of the comic (and Transformers in general) from the 1980s.

The TransformCast is available over on the [Moving Pictures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3x11MgSAntPTP676kXPw-g) YouTube channel. Be gentle and give feedback as we strive to improve as we go on!
